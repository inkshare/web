Hello! I’m Malli Kosuri, the **Founder and Engineer** of **InkShare**. With 16 years of development experience and a passion for practical solutions, I’m here to make note-taking smarter and simpler.

My journey with InkShare is all about combining traditional experiences with modern technology—creating tools that feel familiar yet bring new digital advantages. From **market strategy** to **hands-on development**, I focus on:

- **Leading teams** and building collaborative environments
- **Recruiting talented freelancers** and managing resources effectively
- **Budgeting** with efficiency to keep innovation sustainable
- **Solution architecture** tailored to real-world needs
- **Strategic documentation** to support clarity and future growth

At InkShare, my goal is to craft AI-powered products that are both intuitive and purposeful. Whether you're a student, a professional, or just someone who loves taking notes, I’m excited to bring you solutions that bridge the gap between analog and digital worlds.
